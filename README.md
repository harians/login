This is a prototype for an automated login script for those using a virtual desktop. Enjoy!  #innovateCETS

The VDI LoginLauncher

Are you moving from building to building for meetings? Are you unable to pay attention to the first minutes of a meeting while you log in to your VDI station? Are you feeling any frustration with the logging into your VDI? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then the Login Launcher is for you!
•An associate who logs in 6 times a day spends approximately 5 minutes a day logging in
•That’s roughly 20 hours a year!
•The Login Launcher takes a few seconds to run 
 
How to use the script

1.Make sure MobilePASS is closed
2.Launch LoginLauncher
3.Enter your credentials
4.Launch Internet Explorer
5.Do you have an internet connection? 
6.If no, and “Guest Portal” appears (the  page to the right ), then move to step 8
7.If yes, and you see Google.com (or any other website), then move to step 9
8.Once credentials are entered, click the “Guest Portal + Citrix” button
9.Once credentials are entered, click the  “Citrix” button 
(“Quick Citrix" has a shorter wait period as the time for a Citrix load will vary.)
   
Pros
•Save time
•Added efficiency

Cons
•Prototype only
•If Guest Portal not connected, then script breaks
•If MobilePASS token is reused in under 30 seconds, then “invalid login”
•If screen resolution varies then MouseClick command may not work 
•If computer is 32 bit, then MobilePASS root directory will differ, and script must be adjusted

Possible enhancements
•More secure/stable .exe file
•Progress bar or status window for script progress
